Disease-app This is a Streamlit web app for predicting Heart Disease and Liver Disease using machine learning models. Users can input their health data to check disease risk and get prediction results with probability and risk level. The app also includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization tools like histograms, heatmaps, line plots, and box plots. A special Histogram Marker Tool lets users mark any value on histograms to compare it with the dataset. The app is built using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and deployed using Streamlit in the Anaconda environment with VS Code.
